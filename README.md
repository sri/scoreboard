# scoreboard
A basketball scoreboard for my little one

# Features
- displays a game clock and a shot clock
- display scores for two teams
- TODO: make this configurable (team selection, mins per quarter & overtime; save to localstorage)

# Usage
- clicking/touching on the clock pauses/starts it
- clicking/touching the score board increments it by one
  (when this happens the shot clock resets)

# Testing
- tested on Pixelbook (latest Chrome) & iPad (latest Safari)
